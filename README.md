# MatthewKelsch-Portfolio

For this portfolio project, I was tasked to create a protfolio using a mockup for reference(not to copy), and a criteria to follow. I feel the protfolio I created captures the criteria aspects, and makes for a functional/reactive portfolio. The overall coding has more CSS than it does HTML. I attempted to optimize space, and squeeze together coding that I could. However, the overall structure of the webpage ended up being quite complex, so a lot of the CSS can't really be squished together. That being said, I could have added more consolidated classes, making it easier to change certain things within the HTML design, but many of the objects that have similar CSS are independant of eachother, and are subject to change individually, so I felt it was a better decision to keep the CSS as it is.

Here are some screenshots of the website itself:
